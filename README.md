<h4>Current State</h4>
I kind of broke the code trying to apply Design Pattern Principles (while fixing the undo/redo mechanism).  (I will be back at development of that as soon as I complete bug2progress frontend).

The actual undo-redo mechanism is slightly dodgy, the workaround for now is to use Git (GUI options provided for the project json file). 
Saving the files mean commits in git, which makes it possible to revert back to previous versions (AKA undo).
